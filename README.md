## Concept

Our very first project for my training course, using HTML/CSS/JS for a single-page application. The main points of this project was to start working together as a group of 5 new trainees, using our newly developped skills and most importantly to work on the same git branch to teach us how to handle merging conflicts. The web app is fully responsive as it one golden rule for our training course.
